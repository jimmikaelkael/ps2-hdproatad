ps2-hdproatad - PS2 HD Pro Kit atad driver
--------------------------------------------

This is an IOP irx module to be used on PlayStation2 connected to an
HD Pro Kit HDD. It comes as a replacement for the original Marcus R. Brown
atad driver, and the module load attempt should be done before the regular
one. The source code is based off Mr Brown's driver and adapted to HDpro
interface to keep compatibility with other PS2SDK HDD related modules and
libraries.

To build sources you need the PS2SDK:
